# Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS + docker + kubernetes out-of-the-box
#### I created it for my personal use, you need to adapt it for your use case if something doesn't fit for you
1. Install ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS with minimal configuration, no additional selection on installation
2. Download the ubuntu.sh
3. sudo chmod +x ubuntu.sh
4. ./ubuntu.sh
5. You have a production ready environment to work with docker, docker-compose, kubernetes, kubectl, aws cli, kind, helm, chrome, vscode, git, git-lfs, vim, tmux and some configurations for .vimrc and .tmux.conf
